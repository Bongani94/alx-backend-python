# Python - Async Comprehension
> An async comprehension is an asynchronous version of a classical comprehension. Asyncio supports two types of asynchronous comprehensions, they are the “async for” comprehension and the “await” comprehension. PEP 530 adds support for using async for in list, set, dict comprehensions and generator expressions.
